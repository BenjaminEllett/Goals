                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Goals is a web site which helps users set and achieve goals.  It does this by helping them measure their progress and 
                    learn from setbacks.  It also helps them prioritize goals because no one can work towards 10 things at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each goal has several parts.  First, each goal has a name and optional description.  Second, it contains an optional 
                    list of lessons learned.  Lessons learned are things the user learned while trying to achieve a goal.  Users 
                    periodically review them so they remember what they learned and so they can reach their goals in less time.  Finally, 
                    a goal has one or more metrics.  Metrics are <strong>very</strong> important because they let a person know how they 
                    are doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metrics allow individuals to measure their progress towards a goal.  Metrics have a name, an optional description, a
                    type (number, time, Yes/No, etc.), a target value, and information about how they are collected and calculated.  Here 
                    is an example.  Suppose an individual wants to reach a heathy weight.  The individual decides to measure their weight 
                    each week on Sunday morning.  Here is the metric the individual creates:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">Metric Name</th>
                        <td>Weight (lbs)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">Type</th>
                        <td>Whole number (non-negative integer)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">Target</th>
                        <td>170</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    The individual can easily create this metric with very little work.  If the individual wants to include a lot of 
                    information and have the site remind him to check the metric weekly, the individual can create a metric with these
                    properties:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">Metric Name</th>
                        <td>Weight (lbs)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">Description</th>
                        <td>My body's weight in pounds (lbs).  It's measure every Sunday night.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">Type</th>
                        <td>Whole number (non-negative integer)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">Measurement Frequency</th>
                        <td>Weekly</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="row">Target</th>
                        <td>170</td>
                    </tr>                   
                </table>
                <p>
                    The main reason there are multiple ways to create a metric is ease of use.  Requiring users to fill out every field 
                    makes the program harder to use.  It also requires more effort and users might not have the time, energy, desire or 
                    need to fill out the optional metric fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users will occasionally not enter metrics.  It can be because they forget, they didn't have time or a different
                    reason.  This is OK.  The Goals web site handles missing metrics.  For example, a user forgets to record 
                    some measurements during a week.  The metric is a weekly metric and records the average week's measurements.  
                    The metric will only use the measurements entered to calculate the average.  If the user records no measurements,
                    that is also OK.  The metric's weekly value will be N/A and charts will exclude weeks with no measurements.

                                    An optional list of lessons learned.  These are notes which explain what the user learned while working 
                                    toward the goal.  For example, if a user's goal is to get to a healthy weight, here are some lessons
                                    the user might have learned:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>An optional list of notes.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        User can optionally ask Goals to show one lessoned learned each day.  This is helpful because it reminds 
                        users of things they may have forgotten.  It also helps them avoid past mistakes.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        A metric has the following properties:

                        <ul>
                            <li>A name</li>
                            <li>An optional description</li>
                            <li>
                                A type.  Here are the allowed types:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Whole number (non-negative integer)</li>
                                    <li>Number (integer)</li>
                                    <li>Number (decimal)</li>
                                    <li>Number (percent)</li>
                                    <li>Boolean (true/false)</li>
                                    <li>Yes / No</li>
                                    <li>Completed / Not completed</li>
                                    <li>Time (hours, minutes, seconds)</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>
                                A target value.  This is the value of the metric when the user achieves their goal.  For example, a
                                user's goal is to lose 10 pounds; the user's weight is 180lbs; and the metric is the user's weight.  
                                The target value would be 170lbs in this case.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>An optional measurement frequency.  Here are the supported values: </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Daily</li>
                                    <li>Certain days of the week</li>
                                    <li>Weekly</li>
                                    <li>Monthly</li>
                                    <li>Any time</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                    There will be a page where users can go to see the metrics which need measurement values.  Basically, 
                                    the site will determine which metrics are ready to be entered and then it will show them on the page.
                                    Metrics which have been entered will be removed from the page.  Metrics which are never entered will
                                    be removed 2 days after the metric's due date.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                    An optional metric period.  The measurement frequency and metric period sound similar but have
                                    different purposes.  The measurement frequency determines how often a user can make measurements.
                                    The metric period determines which measurements are converted to a metric value using the 
                                    metric function.  Sum, average, and count are examples of metric functions.  
                                    
                                    Here is an example.  If a user wants to measure how much time he spend exercising each week, he 
                                    would create the following metric:
                                </p>

                                <table>
                                    <tr>
                                        <th>Metric Name</th>
                                        <td>Exercise time</td>
                                    </tr>

                                    <tr>
                                        <th>Type</th>
                                        <td>Time</td>
                                    </tr>

                                    <tr>
                                        <th>Measurement Frequency</th>
                                        <td>Any time</td>
                                    </tr>

                                    <tr>
                                        <th>Metric Period</th>
                                        <td>Weekly - The week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday</td>
                                    </tr>

                                    <tr>
                                        <th>Metric Aggregation Function</th>
                                        <td>Sum</td>
                                    </tr>
                                </table>
                                
                                <p>                                
                                    The value of the metric for a particular week would be the sum of all of the measurements during a particular week.
                                    For example, a user exercises 2 hours on Monday, 1.5 hours the next day, and 0.5 hours on Friday.  The metric's 
                                    value would be 4 hours because the metric's period is a week, its aggregation function is sum and all 3 measurements
                                    were made during the same week.

                                    For some metrics, the measurement frequency and metric period are the same.  For example, a metric 
                                    which measures a person's weight each week might set them the same because the person only measures 
                                    their weight once each week.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                An optional metric function.  This is only required if more than 1 measurement can be measured
                                during a measurement period.  Here is a list of the valid values:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sum</li>
                                    <li>Average</li>
                                    <li>Count</lie>

                                A list of zero or more measurements.  Each measurement consists of a value and the instant (date 
                                and time) it was recorded.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A metric's current value.  This can be several things.

                                <ol>
                                    <li>If the metric has no measurements during the metric period, it's value is N/A (not available)</li>
                                    <li>If the metric only has one measurement, it's the measurement's value.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        If the metric has multiple measurements, it's value is computed by passing all of the measurements 
                                        to the the metric function.

                    <li>Users can create, update and delete goals</li>

                        Users can create, update and delete metric values.  The reason is users sometimes make mistakes and need to 
                        correct them.

                    <li>User can visualize their progress using graphs</li>

                <h2>User Interface Design</h3>

                <p>The user interface will consist of several pages:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Main page</strong> - This is displayed when the user first goes to the web site and is not logged in.  It 
                        states what the site does and has a Sign In button in the upper right corner.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Main signed in user page</strong> - This page has two parts.  First, it shows the metrics which 
                        need measurements.  User can enter metric values here.  Second, it will show all of the user's goals and metrics 
                        in priority order.  Users can add, update, and delete goals and metrics.  Clicking on a goal goes into the goal's 
                        page.  Clicking on a metric goes to the metric's page.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Goal page</strong> - This page shows all of a goal's properties including name, description, metrics, 
                        lessons learned and notes.  Users can change the goal's properties. They can also manage notes, lesson's learned, 
                        and metrics.  Clicking on a metric goes to the metric's page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Metric page</strong> - This page shows a metric's properties including name, type, measurement frequency, 
                        metric period, metric function, measurements, and current value.  Users can change a metric's properties. Users 
                        can also add, update and delete measurements.
                    </li>
